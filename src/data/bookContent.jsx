    <h3>Chapter 1: Down the Rabbit Hole</h3>
    <p>
      Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank, and of having nothing to do:
      once or twice she had peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in it,
      'and what is the use of a book,' thought Alice 'without pictures or conversation?'
    </p>
    <p>
      So she was considering in her own mind, as well as she could,
      for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid, whether the pleasure of making a daisy chain would be worth the trouble of getting up
      and picking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was nothing very remarkable in that, nor did Alice think it so very much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself,
      'Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be too late.' But when the Rabbit actually took a watch out of its waistcoat pocket and looked at it and ran on,
      Alice started to her feet, for she had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat pocket, or a watch to take out of it,
      and, burning with curiosity, she ran across the field after it.
